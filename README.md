# Event Manager Project

This project has been assigned on theodinproject.com.

Through this project, I was able to solidify my knowledge on reading/writing to files, creating files/folders, and formatting/creating ERB (Embedded RuBy) files. Additionally, I practiced how to read content from a CSV file, how to transform the file into a standardized format, and manipulating strings. I was then able to utilize the Google API, Civic Info v2, by feeding the API information garnered from the CSV file to gather information about a person's legislator and the legislator's website.

Using the information from the Civic Info API, I then was able to produce personalized letters to each registrant from the CSV file which include the registrant's first name, their legislator's name and website. I was also able to solidify my knowledge of Exception handling through Begin/Raise/Rescue, DateTime methods, as well as array/hash data manipulation.  

In future projects, I wish to be able to interact with more API's and to further solidify my grasp on arrays/hashes.
